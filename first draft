<p id="under-image" class="text-center" class="img-responsive">There was once an illusive creature that originated out of the small town of Strum, Wisconsin.
  </p>
  <p id="under-image2" class="text-center"> Although rarely found there now, this rare being can be found and captured (in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu81lja2lX4 ">film</a>) all over the world.</p>

<p id="main-paragraph" class="text-center">Lauren's stories are MANY and have been documented below, in "2 truths and 1 lie " format of course... only adding permanence to the complexity of this life form. If you can spot 15 truths and 5 lies correctly... nothing cool will happen on this webpage. I am a beginner coder... what do you expect from me. Enjoy.</p>

<h2 id="title"> 15 truths and 5 lies </h2>                                                                        
<ul>
  <li>A Lauren in the wild once flashed the country side of Stavanger, NO from a cliff. In the middle of the day. sober. when people were filming in the foreground.</li>
                        
  <li>She once traveled to Ho Chi Minh City.</li>
                                                     <li>If you're lucky enough to catch it, this creature can walk around the knuckles of her toes for minutes at a time. She usually performs this feat for groups of people when there is a dull moment, just to spice things up.</li>

  <li>The best firework display Lauren was ever found enjoying was in a mountain town with a population of just over 2,000 people. It was in this town that she rode on a grizzly bear's back. </li>
  
   <li>This wild thing was once day drinking on a beach in Mexico and decided she wanted a tattoo. She proceded to go off solo and find an open shop to create a quarter sized panda bear on the inside of her left bicep. Hardly anyone sees this tattoo. they are secret buddies... the panda's name is Jose, and they discuss most of her life decisions.</li>
  
  <li>A Lauren in the wild once went indoors to do a keg stand at her older sister's baby shower.</li>

  <li>Lauren was once seen riding a horse through the mountains of the western United States. She kicked it because she thought it would be fun to go faster. The horse proceded to charge up an unknown mountain side for the next 20 minutes with Lauren screaming her head off. She only got a minor scrape on her cheek from an overhanging pine tree branch.</li> 
  <li>Lauren performed a rap battle on television. It was about how she promised to never eat a cow, if only it would come over to her side of the field. The cow never came. </li>
  <li>This lady once wore rainboots to her friends wedding. </li>            
  <li>Pictures of Lauren can be found in Hawaii where she was a hand model.</li>    
  
  <li>Lauren has completed the following in a 24 hour period: skydived, gambled and won $1000, drank 6 bloody marys, visited for an hour with a hooker about politics, met Chris Angel and snuck into a rooftop pool. In Vegas. </li>   
  
  <li>A Lauren enjoys falling asleep to the sounds of a horror story podcast. Especially when camping.</li>
  
  <li>Lauren got her hair done in Oslo at a salon named Angels Afro. Her hair took so long they took a break, locked the dorrs and threw a pizza party. Overall, she was in this hair studio about 8 hours. There were many discussions about french underwear.</li>                                               
  <li>As a young wild one, Lauren stretched her perfomance skills by lip syncing to elvis in her school's talent shows. She was especially talented at gettting the hip shake down.</li>
